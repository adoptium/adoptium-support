        All bug reports must have steps to reproduce. Otherwise, we cannot work on it! A crash dump is not sufficient!
        
        Please provide a minimal, reproducible example that we can run locally. See
        https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example for what that means.
        A public GitHub repository works best. See
        https://github.com/aahlenst/datetimeformatter-parse-bug for a live example.
