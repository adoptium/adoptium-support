# Adoptium Support

This repository is used to track issues raised by end-users against binaries produced from Adoptium projects (including Eclipse Temurin).

Templates are available for raising issues.

## Triaging Issues

Our bug reporting templates will ask you to also test your issue against an upstream binary or one by an alternative provider.

During our attempt to triage the issue with you at Adoptium, if we discover that it's an upstream issue then we'll report it upstream on your behalf or in some cases ask you to do so.

## Issues that are OpenJDK upstream issues

It's important to note that Adoptium is a binary provider and that source code fixes happen at [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net).

## Community Support

There is free (best efforts) based support via our Slack community which you can join at [https://adoptium.net/slack.html](https://adoptium.net/slack.html).

For more options on support, see [https://adoptium.net/support.html](https://adoptium.net/support.html).
